## `exercise01`

### `exercise01a`

### `exercise01b`

define a `SecurityDoor` constructor function that inherits the bhehaviour from `Door` but once `closed` a `security_door` instance can be `locked` via the `lock` method. Invoking the `unlock` method, bring the `security_door` back to the `close` state.
